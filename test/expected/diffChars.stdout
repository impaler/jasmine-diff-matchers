[37m“How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, “This is better than we thought!
The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant?” Instead they say,
“No, no, no! My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.” A religion, old or new, that stressed
the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and
awe hardly tapped by the conventional fai[39m[32mry [39m[37mt[39m[32male[39m[31mh[39m[37ms.”

“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know,
everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our
joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager,
every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love,

“It is sometimes said that scientists are unromantic, that their passion to figure out robs the world of
beauty and mystery. But is it not stirring to understand how the world actually works — that white light is
made of colors, that color is the way we perceive the wavelengths of light, that transparent air reflects light,
that in so doing it discriminates among the waves, and that the sky is blue for the same reason that the sunset is red?
It does no harm to the romance of the sunset to know a little bit about it.”
